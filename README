ALL PROGRAMS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND ARE FAR FROM BEING FINISHED

'mds02' fetches data from an 'PGR' or 'AVR' device, decodes it
	into human readable format with aviation typical dimensions
	and stores it in a shared memory region
	
	data from each icao address found are stored in a unique
	data block in this region

	writes a log file with progress- and error infos
	
	see (and edit) 'mds02.h' for program parameters
	without modification 'mds' will be build for
		- accepting data from a PGR device via '/dev/ttyACM0'
		- no parameters are sent to PGR device on program start
		- max. 100 icao addresses (planes) in shared memory
		- planes (icao adresses) are deleted after 120 seconds
		  without update
		- no decoding of messages from df20/21 (try and error method)
		- cpr ambiguity solving with odd/even position reports
	
	see 'mds02.h' for description of shared memory contents
	
'mds02pr'
	example of how to access and use data from shared memory
	
	prints in a terminal window some selected data from shared
	memory once per second (uses 'vt100' character sequences for
	cursor and screen control, ok for 'xterm' and others, needs
	line length of at least 80 characters)

building
	use 'make' to build 'mds02' and 'mds02pr' ('Makefile' supplied)
	you need curl (search libcurl) for web lookup of flight information
	you also need TCL 8.5 (see if tclsh is available)

running
	use 'mds02 -h' to get infos on command line parameters

	start 'mds02' with appropriate parameters in a separate
	terminal (xterm) window or in background ( ... &)
	
	then start 'mds02pr' (without any parameter)
